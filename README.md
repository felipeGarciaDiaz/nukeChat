# nukeChat
## IOS Mobile Private Chat with a deep focus on privacy
Nuke Chat allows you to create a private room where you can invite anyone to have secure communication. none of your messages get saved. there is no database storing your information, and there is no need to create an account. just click one button and you are ready to go.

## Nuke button?

The nuke button is what gives nuke chat its name, and what gives this program a unique take on regular secure messaging. At any point anyone who has access to the private room you created can choose to wipe and reload the entire chatroom they're in. Thus eraising any messages associated with that room, for themselves and the other people.
